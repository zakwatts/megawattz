I've thought about making a set of watches for a while. I't would be great if I could use old bits of circuit boards for the watch face. 

Even better, i could have an led around the edge of the watch that uses reflections of some sort to of a digiitally addressed LED strip to turn the lights on and off when a button pressed which would show the time.
